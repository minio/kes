# The API configuration. The APIs exposed by the KES server can
# be adjusted here. Each API is identified by its API path.
#
# In general, the KES server uses sane defaults for all APIs.
# Only customize the APIs if there is a real need.
# 
# Disabling authentication for an API must be carefully evaluated.
# One example, when disabling authentication may be justified, would
# be the liveness and readiness probes in a Kubernetes environment.
#
# When authentication is disabled, the particular API can be
# accessed by any client that can send HTTPS requests to the
# KES server.
#
# When disabling authentication for any API, the KES server will
# change its TLS handshake behavior. By default, KES requires that
# a client sends a client certificate during the handshake or KES
# aborts the handshake. This means that a client can only send an
# HTTP request to KES when it provides a certificate during the
# handshake. This is no longer the case when authentication is 
# disabled for at least one API. Clients should be able to call
# the API even without a certificate. Hence, KES can no longer
# require a certificate during the TLS handshake but instead has
# to check the certificate when executing the API handler. 
# 
# Now, these two behaviors have slightly different semantics:
# By default, KES does not accept connections from clients without
# a TLS certificate. When disabling authentication for one API, KES
# has to accept connections from any client for all APIs. However,
# the API handlers that still require authentication will reject
# requests from clients without a certificate. Instead of a TLS
# error these clients will receive an HTTP error.
#
# Currently, authentication can only be disabled for the
# following APIs:
#   - /v1/ready
#   - /v1/status
#   - /v1/metrics
#   - /v1/api
#
api:
  /v1/ready:
    skip_auth: false
    timeout:   15s
    
# The (pre-defined) policy definitions.
#
# A policy must have an unique name (e.g my-app) and specifies which
# server APIs can be accessed. An API path pattern is a glob pattern
# of the following form:
#   <API-version>/<API>/<operation>/[<argument-0>/<argument-1>/...]>
#
# Each KES server API has an unique path - e.g. /v1/key/create/<key-name>.
# A client request is allowed if and only if no deny pattern AND at least one
# allow pattern matches the request URL path.
#
# A policy has zero (by default) or more assigned identities. However,
# an identity can never be assigned to more than one policy at the same
# time. So, one policy has N assigned identities but one identity is
# assigned to at most one policy.
#
# In general, each user/application should only have the minimal
# set of policy permissions to accomplish whatever it needs to do.
# Therefore, it is recommended to define policies based on workflows
# and then assign them to the identities.

# The following policy section shows some example policy definitions.
# Please remove/adjust to your needs.

# The console logging configuration. In general, the KES server
# distinguishes between (operational) errors and audit events.
# By default, the KES server logs error events to STDERR but
# does not log audit log events to STDOUT.
#
# The following log configuration only affects logging to console.
log:
  # Enable/Disable logging error events to STDERR. Valid values
  # are "on" or "off". If not set the default is "on". If no error
  # events should be logged to STDERR it has to be set explicitly
  # to: "off".
  error: on

  # Enable/Disable logging audit events to STDOUT. Valid values
  # are "on" and "off". If not set the default is "off".
  # Logging audit events to STDOUT may flood your console since
  # there will be one audit log event per request-response pair.
  #
  # For tracing/monitoring audit logs take a look at the
  # /v1/log/audit/trace API.
  #
  # Each audit event is a JSON object representing a request-response
  # pair that contains the time, client identity, the API path, HTTP
  # response status code etc.
