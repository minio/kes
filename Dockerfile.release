      description="KES as the bridge between modern applications - running as containers on Kubernetes - and centralized KMS solutions. Therefore, KES has been designed to be simple, scalable and secure by default. It has just a few knobs to tweak instead of a complex configuration and does not require a deep understanding of secure key-management or cryptography."
