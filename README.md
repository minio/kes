## What is KES?

KES is a distributed key management server that scales horizontally. It can either be run as edge server close to the applications
reducing latency to and load on a central key management system (KMS) or as central key management service. KES nodes are self-contained
stateless instances that can be scaled up and down automatically.

## Install

The KES server and CLI is available as a single binary, container image or can be build from source.

Download the binary via `curl` but replace `<OS>` and `<ARCH>` with your operating system and CPU architecture.
```
curl -sSL --tlsv1.2 'https://github.com/minio/kes/releases/latest/download/kes-<OS>-<ARCH>' -o ./kes
```
```
chmod +x ./kes
```

You can also verify the binary with [minisign](https://jedisct1.github.io/minisign/) by downloading the corresponding [`.minisig`](https://github.com/minio/kes/releases/latest) signature file. 
Run:
```
curl -sSL --tlsv1.2 'https://github.com/minio/kes/releases/latest/download/kes-<OS>-<ARCH>.minisig' -o ./kes.minisig
```
```
minisign -Vm ./kes -P RWTx5Zr1tiHQLwG9keckT0c45M3AGeHD6IvimQHpyRywVWGbP1aVSGav

Download and install the binary via your Go toolchain:

```sh
go install github.com/minio/kes/cmd/kes@latest
```

## Quick Start
   
We run a public KES instance at `https://play.min.io:7373` as playground.
You can interact with our play instance either via the KES CLI or cURL.
Alternatively, you can get started by setting up your own KES server in
less than five minutes.
   
<details><summary><b>First steps</b></summary>

#### 1. Configure CLI
Point the KES CLI to the KES server at `https://play.min.io:7373` and use the following API key:
```sh
export KES_SERVER=https://play.min.io:7373
export KES_API_KEY=kes:v1:AD9E7FSYWrMD+VjhI6q545cYT9YOyFxZb7UnjEepYDRc
```

#### 3. Create a Key
Create a new root encryption key - e.g. `my-key`.
```
kes key create my-key
```
> Note that creating a new key will fail with `key already exist` if it already exist.

#### 4. Generate a DEK
Derive a new data encryption keys (DEK).
```sh
kes key dek my-key
```
The plaintext part of the DEK would be used by an application to encrypt some data.
The ciphertext part of the DEK would be stored alongside the encrypted data for future
decryption.

## Monitoring

KES servers provide an API endpoint `/v1/metrics` that observability tools, like Prometheus, can scrape.
Refer to the [monitoring documentation](https://min.io/docs/kes/concepts/monitoring/) for how to setup and capture KES metrics.

For a graphical Grafana dashboard refer to the following [example](examples/grafana/dashboard.json).

## FAQs

<details><summary><b>I have received an <code>insufficient permissions</code> error</b></summary>
   
This means that you are using a KES identity that is not allowed to perform a specific operation, like creating or listing keys.

The KES [admin identity](https://github.com/minio/kes/blob/6452cdc079dfae54e4a46102cb4622c80b99776f/server-config.yaml#L8)
can perform any general purpose API operation. You should never experience a `not authorized: insufficient permissions`
error when performing general purpose API operations using the admin identity.

In addition to the admin identity, KES supports a [policy-based](https://github.com/minio/kes/blob/6452cdc079dfae54e4a46102cb4622c80b99776f/server-config.yaml#L77) access control model.
You will receive a `not authorized: insufficient permissions` error in the following two cases:
1. **You are using a KES identity that is not assigned to any policy. KES rejects requests issued by unknown identities.**
   
   This can be fixed by assigning a policy to the identity. Checkout the [examples](https://github.com/minio/kes/blob/6452cdc079dfae54e4a46102cb4622c80b99776f/server-config.yaml#L79-L88).
2. **You are using a KES identity that is assigned to a policy but the policy either not allows or even denies the API call.**
   
   In this case, you have to grant the API permission in the policy assigned to the identity. Checkout the [list of APIs](https://github.com/minio/kes/wiki/Server-API#api-overview).
   For example, when you want to create a key you should allow the `/v1/key/create/<key-name>`. The `<key-name>` can either be a
   specific key name, like `my-key-1` or a pattern allowing arbitrary key names, like `my-key*`.
   
   Also note that deny rules take precedence over allow rules. Hence, you have to make sure that any deny pattern does not
   accidentally matches your API request.
